### Hi there 👋

I have over three decades of software development. My current interests are, in no particular order

👨🏻‍💻 Cross-platform C#/.NET development (MacOS/Windows)

🕹 Retrogaming (trying to learn [@batariBasic](https://github.com/batari-Basic/batari-Basic) in my free time, but it is difficult)

📱 iOS development (Swift/XCode/Apple TV)

🌳 Genealogy

If you are into one or more of the above, I'm looking to collaborate!
